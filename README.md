# GameUtils
Welcome! Glad to see you around! This repository is currently a `WIP`, but there wil be a lot more to this down the line. 

## What is this?
This repository is inspired by other developers in the Game Industry that have created an open library of scripts in Unity, Unreal Engine, and other engines that are using the _same_ exact lines of code. To save time, I usually end up copying code from other projects, which also come from other projects. This led me thinking; why not make a repository just for this? So that it'll be easy to reference this?

## Will this be only for games?
Mostly! I do have another place for specific scripts in a non-game setting [here](https://github.com/maishiroma/OneOffScripts). 

## Is all of the content here yours?
Yes! If not, I made sure to credit the original source + owner of the script that I found it at!

## Is this really open and free?
Sure! Sharing is caring after all. :)
